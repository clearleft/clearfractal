After Blair’s acclaimed presentation last year at our Founders Assembly event, we knew we wanted to work with him again - and luckily he’s agreed to lead his excellent Win Without Pitching workshop for us. This will have a strictly limited capacity, at a fantastic - but small - venue, to give attendees a more concentrated, rewarding experience. So - if you’re an agency founder, in business development, or want to hone your pitching skills, this is an essential session.",
