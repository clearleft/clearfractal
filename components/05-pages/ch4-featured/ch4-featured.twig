    <h2>So how do you work together to understand your users?</h2>
    <p>The Clearleft team kicked off with a collaborative workshop in our Brighton studio to dig deeper into the needs and expectations of the news audience. Channel 4 News took us through their audience archetypes, which was a great starting point for us.</p>
    <p>For good design to work, everyone involved needs to be in agreement on the priorities of the project. By getting everyone in a room together, there was a great sense of collaboration and co-creation between Clearleft, Channel 4, and ITN.</p>
    <p>By getting everyone together we also learned that some users want bite size news and other people want in-depth reporting on newsworthy topics. So how do you provide for these varying needs?</p>

    I remember a really good sense of collaboration. There were a lot of moving partsâ€”us at Clearleft, the team at Channel 4, but also the team at ITN. I think we had a really good working relationship between all of those people.
