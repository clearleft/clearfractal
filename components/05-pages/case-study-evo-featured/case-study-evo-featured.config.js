            <p>Evo’s existing app was well-regarded and had a loyal fan base, but its traditional, page-turn format wasn’t allowing that fan base to grow. 
            Our brief was to create a product that still delivered a rich editorial experience, but would widen the audience and prolong reader engagement.</p>
            <p>We were approached by Dennis Media Factory to help them define that strategy and create a vision for the next iteration of the magazine’s native apps.</p>
