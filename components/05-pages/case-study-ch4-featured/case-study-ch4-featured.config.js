            <p>We had worked with Channel 4 News before, designing their mobile apps and refreshing their website, but this was the biggest challenge yet.
            We needed to find tiny ways to make big changes to a vast eco-system of content production to make it more suitable for mobile consumption.
            Not only did the new website need to adapt to many devices and screen sizes, it needed to adapt to the fast-paced way the news itself gets
            produced.</p>
            <p>Channel 4 and ITN work together to deliver the news, which means there are lots of people involved at each stage. They have an enormous responsibility to the
            public but their online strategy didn’t reflect the many ways in which news is captured and consumed. The Channel 4 news team have a passion
            for the power of journalism, so together we set out to design a way to convey that passion on the web.</p>

            <p>The agile manifesto was born out of a frustration with traditionally managed projects. But I don’t think it solved the problem. It actually created another one. I’ve seen teams and
            organisations go from waterfall, which reduces their ability to compete in the market and deliver value, to dysfunction and paralysis when implementing agile.</p>
            <p>That’s largely due to the various interpretations of the manifesto borne of misunderstanding. Bottom-up as well as top-down support is needed in order for a successful agile transformation to take place in any organisation.</p>
