**Recommended max characters approximately 8**

As you can see above, doesn't wrap well on strings longer than that.

We could add word-wrap, but then it tends to break prematurely on the `+` on something like `20,000+`. We could add manual hyphenation with soft hyphens to overcome that, but possibly more trouble than its worth in the CMS, and possibly tricky to explain to end users.
